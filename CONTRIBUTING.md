## How can I contribute?

### Reporting bugs

#### Before submitting a bug report

* **Check** the [forum](https://forum.omz-software.com/category/5/pythonista) for a list of common questions.
* **Check** wheter the issue you are experiencing is [already reported](https://github.com/omz/Pythonista-Issues/issues/). If it is already reported, you can click on the _Subscribe_ button to receive further development info or you can add more details.
* **Check** if you're using the [latest version](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pythonista-3/id1085978097?ls=1&mt=8). Bug reports should be based on the latest available version. If you're using Pythonista beta version, test your issue with the latest available version from the Test Flight.

#### How do I submit a (good) bug report?

* **Isolate problem** - The first step is to identify what the problem is. Saying "something is wrong" is not helpful. Saying what exactly is wrong, how to reproduce it, is.
* **Separate issues** - If you have multiple issues, please, file them separately.
* **Use clear and descriptive title**.
* **Steps to reproduce** - Include all steps how to reproduce your issue. More details, faster resolution. Don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it (tapping on, hw keyboard, ...).
* **Sample code** - Sample code demonstrating your issue is very helpful. If it's short, include it directly in the issue. Read [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to learn how to include code in the issue. [Gist](https://gist.github.com) is preferred in case your code is long.
* **System information** - It's always good to attach system information. Your issue can be iPhone, iPad, iOS, Python interpreter version specific. Example (preformatted Markdown for GitHub issues):

```
**System Information**

* Pythonista 3.1.1 (311015), Default interpreter 3.6.1
* iOS 11.0.3, model iPad, resolution (portrait) 2048.0 x 2732.0 @ 2.0
```

If you don't know from where to get this information, download and run [sysinfo.py](scripts/sysinfo.py) script.
